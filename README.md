Homework 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refractor
Kevin Connell

My goal was to refactor the existing code to ensure web accessibility for people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions. I also removed unnessesary code, and updated all semantic tags to their most relevant labeled purpose to optimize search engine analytics.  Lastly, I consolidated stylistic elements and inserted comments so the code can be more easily read, understood, and updated in the future. 

	▪	Removed unnecessary code
	▪	Added comments
	▪	Added alt tags for all images
	▪	Titled the website appropriately
	▪	Updated to descriptive semantic HTML tags (no div)
	▪	Consolidated redundant classes in CSS
	▪	Organized code for readability and understanding
	▪	Prepared website for easy updates
